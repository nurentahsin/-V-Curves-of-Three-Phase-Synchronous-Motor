First we have to connect three phase connection to the stator of the motor, thus motor will behave like an induction motor and the motor will obtain its speed slightly less than synchronous speed. And all of this can be achieved by three
phase supply with TPST for synchronous motor. Now, virtual simulation would be run for synchronous motor and it can be tested for three condition. First, we will try the no load condition and no load means there is no resistive force
acting upon the motor. Lastly, we will try the full load condition where all five resistive load are connected
